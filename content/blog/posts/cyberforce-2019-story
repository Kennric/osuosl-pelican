The Oregon State Security Club has placed first in the regional CyberForce Competition that is hosted yearly 
by the Department of Energy. This past November is the third consecutive year the OSU computer science students have 
placed first in the region. The team placed sixth on the national level, which was made up of over 100 teams. 

The members of the team included: Cody Holliday, Ryan Kennedy, Matt Jansen, Khuong Luu, Zach Rogers, and Zander Work. 
They were advised by assistant professor of computer science Yeongjin Jang.

The Cyberforce Competition is a creation of the Department of Energy, and is meant to raise awareness of key issues 
with cyber security and provide hands-on experience for college students. 

Zander Work, president of the OSU Security Club, commented on his experience with the competition. “I really enjoy 
getting to test out my defensive skills in a live environment against a skilled red team. I also enjoy the added twist 
of securing some real-world industrial infrastructure, rather than a typical IT environment.”
