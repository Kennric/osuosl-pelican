The OSL partners with `Ampere Computing`_ to host `ARM`_-based servers in order to provide an open platform for
innovation to the open source community. Current projects embrace open software projects ranging from KVM to OpenStack
and open collaboration with open source based ISV and distribution partners, such Red Hat, SUSE and Ubuntu, who support
the latest ARM hardware via production and development (Fedora, CentOS, OpenSUSE, and Debian) distributions.

Members of the community can use these ARM servers to develop and test open source projects on the ARM Architecture
platform and in a ARM environment.

OpenStack
---------

Our primary resource is an OpenStack based cluster offering ARM64 & ARM32 instances running on KVM and providing access
via OpenStack's API and GUI interface.  These shared systems are intended for functional development and continuous
integration work, but are not ideal for performance testing.  We start projects out with a small quota, but can
increase given resource availability and justification.

To request access to an OpenStack ARM instance, use our `ARM OpenStack request form`_.
