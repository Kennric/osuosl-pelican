"GPGPUSim+Ramulator Simulator","Yunfan Li at Oregon State is using POWER to calibrate a cycle accurate GPU simulator with a real GPU chip."
"Julia Language","Collaboration between IBM, OSU, and Julia Language mathematical software community enabled developers to use graphics processing unit (GPU) technology. This made the software ready for the new CAPI and NVLink acceleration technologies. This was an instrumental step in getting independent software vendors to port to POWER."
"Lecture Video Summarization","There are large number of educational videos on YouTube and other platforms. However the lack of any content based access to the videos make them very difficult to be queried. A students has to watch the full video or jump or fast forward to see whether the video is of his/her interest or not. This summarization tool aims to make such videos more useful and interactive along with a content based index."
